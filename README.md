# gscholar-scraper
Takes a keyword and returns papers sorted by amount of citations, a simple tool used for my final year project when scouting the most influential papers in a desired topic area.

Google has since made changes to how they handle webscrapers, rendering this tool much more inconsistent due to reCaptcha enforcement.

##Update 17/7/23

I have changed the implementation so that the tool works again, manual reCaptcha solving is required for the time being.
