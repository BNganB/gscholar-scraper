# gscholar-scraper
Takes a keyword and returns papers sorted by amount of citations, a simple tool used for my final year project when scouting the most influential papers in a desired topic area.

Google has since made changes to how they handle webscrapers, rendering this tool much more inconsistent due to reCaptcha enforcement.
