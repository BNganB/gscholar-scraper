# gscholar-scraper
Takes a keyword and returns papers sorted by amount of citations, a small project used for my final year project when scouting the most influential papers in a topic area.

Google has since made changes to how they handle webscrapers, rendering this tool much more inconsistent due to reCaptcha enforcement.
